        <img src="../../../images/soma/100-days.jpg" width="100%" alt="Dr. Cezar T. Quiambao giving his SOMA">

        <p>Newly elected mayor Dr. Cezar T. Quiambao had barely warmed his seat, but he was already in the thick of municipal work to deliver his solemn election campaign promises. Officially taking the reins on July 1 from an outgoing administration naturally involved a lot of familiarization tours, consultations with various constituents, and strategizing and planning work.</p>

        <p>With a strong mandate for change echoing that of President Duterte’s administration, it was like starting from scratch for the new mayor-elect, who is fondly called by his erstwhile monicker in the corporate world, ‘CTQ.’ But backed up by an unprecedented mix of young blood, returning native sons and daughters, and citizens in their senior years, Mayor CTQ’s reign is gifted with electric energy, the strong yearning to serve and give back to a waiting hometown, and the wisdom of age.</p>
        
        <p>The first 100 days of MCTQ’s administration were definitely as high-spirited as they were busy. Topmost of the priorities was the organization of a transition team called Transparency Team within the first month. This involves selecting members equipped with an understanding of government operation, reports, documentation, and other related matters to ensure a proper, effective and transparent turnover.</p>
        
        <p>Reorganizing the various executive departments was the second topmost priority. Here, the existing organizational structure was reviewed and a revised chart was prepared. This resulted in – in CTQ’s own words – “an organization that is more responsive and effective in addressing the needs of the people.” This was backed up by the creation of the right Sangguniang Bayan (SB) resolutions needed to deliver the strategy of implementation.</p>
        
        <p>Strategic planning was conducted next, and this was carried out by inviting the DILG Local Government Academy as modulator. With this, the Mayor was able to come up with the Local Development Agenda in consonance with national government programs.</p>
        
        <p>Mandated councils or special bodies were reorganized and reconstituted next. This was done by appointing corresponding members of the special bodies in accordance with RA 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. Special bodies or councils were reconstituted to assist the Executive and Legislative offices in setting the direction of economic and social development of the town.</p>
        
        <p>The financial performance of the LGU was determined for three reasons: to review the previous budget, especially for the 1Q and 2Q 2016; to prepare the budget for 2017 as per Local Development Agenda; and to identify financial sources and generate enough funds to compensate for the requirement of the budget. The result was a better understanding of the LGU’s financial conditions.</p>
        
        <p>Familiarization with the LGU operations and making it more corporate in approach without going beyond the mandate was up next in the agenda.</p>
        
        <p>Relationship was developed between the national government agencies that cater the same services with LGU such as skills training and development for poverty reduction program. This was specifically achieved by establishing relationship and coordination between and among TESDA, DTI, DOST, ALS, and ABOT ALAM of DepEd in the conduct of training programs.</p>
        
        <p>Executive and Legislative Agenda conferences were conducted with the help of the DILG MLGOO as modulator to introduce and formulate Executive Agenda (plans and programs) with Legislative Agenda (legislation). The aim was to have a harmonized Executive and Legislative Agenda to establish protocol in passing local measures and proper implementation.
        Community consultations with barangay leaders were conducted next. Regular meetings were held with Barangay Councils to present the Local Development Agenda. The aim was to make the barangay leaders be aware of and well-informed on the LGU Development Agenda.</p>
        
        <p>Consultations with different organizations were likewise conducted. Various institutions were mobilized, including NGOs, education sector, senior citizens, farmers, and religious to establish good mutual relationship in achieving the LGU Development Agenda. A persuasive force was thereby created in promoting the development of the municipality.</p>
        
        <p>Present and future plans of action were formulated by establishing a Short-Term Plan (1 year), Medium-Term Plan (2 years) and Long-Term Plan (3 years).</p>
        
        <p>Four additional LGU offices were created through legislation and provision of funding: General Services Office (GSO), Public Order and Safety Office (POSO), Management Information System Office, and Tourism Office. These new offices are vital in implementing quality service, providing the public with an organized direction of LGU facility and services. POSO is specifically meant to provide the locals with a better traffic and parking management system.</p>
        
        <p>By the 100th day, several doable projects had been either implemented or completed, including the establishment of a CCTV Command Center as a tool to help deter and solve crimes, street lights along the streets of the Poblacion, the imposition of a zoning scheme for the Public Market Block II and III, initiation of a community-based Sustainable Livelihood Training Program, awarding of scholarships to poor but deserving students, rehabilitation of Solid Waste Management and re-establishment of the Material Recovery Facility, and the creation of the emergency hotline #4357 (HELP).</p>
